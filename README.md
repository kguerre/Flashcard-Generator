# Advanced JavaScript Assignment: Cloze Constructors

### Overview

In this assignment, I created the backend for a basic flashcard application using constructors.

**Basic** flashcards have a front and back side. The front will ask the question, while the back contains the answer. For example: the front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and back (_"George Washington"_).

**Cloze-Deleted** flashcards display partial text, where the user is asked to fill in the blank with the correct answer, and the full text, which is the completed statement. For example: _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)
